# Python samples for Azure DevOps

This repository contains Python samples that show how to integrate with Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server (TFS) using the [Azure DevOps Python API](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-python-api).

**As of January 2021, we're no longer actively maintaining this repo.**
Feel free to continue using it for inspiration or examples.
We won't be updating or adding any samples, though.

## Explore

Samples are organized by "area" (service) and "resource" within the `samples` package.
Each sample module shows various ways for interacting with Azure DevOps and TFS.
Resources may have multiple samples, since there are often multiple ways to query for a given resource.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

2. Create a virtual environment (`python3 -m venv env && . env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`)

Now you can run `runner.py` with no arguments to see available options.

## Run the samples - command line

> **VERY IMPORTANT**: some samples are destructive! It is recommended that you run these samples against a test organization.

1. Get a [personal access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops).

2. Store the PAT and organization URL you'll be running samples against (note: some samples are destructive, so use a test organization):
   * `python runner.py config url --set-to https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam`
   * `python runner.py config pat --set-to ABC123`
   * If you don't want your PAT persisted to a file, you can put it in an environment variable called `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` instead

3. Run `python runner.py run {area} {resource}` with the 2 required arguments:
   * `{area}`: API area (currently `core`, `git`, and `work_item_tracking`) to run the client samples for. Use `all` to include all areas.
   * `{resource}`: API resource to run the client samples for. Use `all` to include all resources.
   * You can optionally pass `--url {url}` to override your configured URL

### Examples

#### Run all samples

```
python runner.py run all all
```

#### Run all work item tracking samples

```
python runner.py run work_item_tracking all
```

#### Run all Git pull request samples

```
python runner.py run git pullrequests
```

#### Run all Git samples against a different URL than the one configured; in this case, a TFS on-premises collection

```
python runner.py run git all --url https://mytfs:8080/tfs/testcollection
```

### Save request and response data to a JSON file

To persist the HTTP request/response as JSON for each client sample method that is run, set the `--output-path {value}` argument. For example:

```
python runner.py run all all --output-path ~/temp/http-output
```

This creates a folder for each area, a folder for each resource under the area folder, and a file for each client sample method that was run. The name of the JSON file is determined by the name of the client sample method. For example:

```
|-- temp
    |-- http-output
        |-- git
            |-- refs
                |-- get_refs.json
                |-- ...
            |-- repositories
                |-- get_repositories.json
                |-- ...
```

Note: certain HTTP headers like `Authorization` are removed for security/privacy purposes.

## See what samples are available

You can run `runner.py list` to see what sample areas and resources are available.

## Run the samples - Jupyter notebook

We also provide a Jupyter notebook for running the samples.
You'll get a web browser where you can enter URL, authentication token, and choose which samples you wish to run.

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

2. Create a virtual environment (`python3 -m venv env && . env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.jupyter.txt`)

3. Get a personal access token.

4. Run `jupyter notebook`. In the resulting web browser, click **API Samples.ipynb**.

5. Click **Run** in the top cell. Scroll down and you'll see a form where you can enter your organization or TFS collection URL, PAT, and choose which samples to run.

> **IMPORTANT**: some samples are destructive. It is recommended that you first run the samples against a test account.
